The goal of europeanaR is to provide tools to access Linked Open Data published
by Europeana. Gain access to millions of entries related to artworks, books,
music, and videos on art, newspapers, archaeology, fashion, science, sport,
and much more. This thesaurus of cultural heritage can be used in numerous
creative ways like for example building applications, data analysis,
Statistical and Deep Learning.

## Getting started

You can install the development version of europeanaR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AleKoure/europeanaR")
```

Sign up for your free API key and get developing [here](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/get-api)! 
When you get you personal key set it as environmental variable.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
europeanaR::set_key("YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE")
```

Alternatively, you can edit `.Renviron` by inserting your personal key to the
environmental variable `EUROPEANA_KEY`,

## Example

The Search API provides a way to search for metadata records and media on the
Europeana repository, for instance give me all results for the word "Vermeer".
The basic API call to the search API can return up to 100 items.

```{r example}
library(europeanaR)
library(data.table)
resp <- query_search_api("Vermeer", rows = 10, reusability = "open")
#transform to tabular data
resp_tidy <- tidy_search_items(resp)
#get preview of first items
first_image <- resp_tidy[type == "IMAGE"][1, edmPreview]
```

<p align="center">
<img align="center" src="`r first_image`">
</p>

The API call repeats in case of an error, and it is designed to be kind to the
server, see [here](https://httr.r-lib.org/reference/RETRY.html). The retrieved
metadata are given in JSON format and are parsed into an R
object using [jsonlite](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2805). In addition, these
data can be transformed in tabular format and are compatible also with the
[data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) package for fast data
manipulation operations.

The response richness can be controlled by using the `profile` query parameter.
Also, get bulk downloads of metadata and associated media files by using
the functions `tidy_cursored_search()` and `download_media()`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bulk_and_rich <- tidy_cursored_search("Vermeer", max_items = 500,
                                      profile = "rich")
```

The Europeana services documentation can be found
[here](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search). See the vignettes section and
other resources at the package
[homepage](https://alekoure.github.io/europeanaR/) for more information
and examples.
