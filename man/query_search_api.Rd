\description{
The Search API allows to search the Europeana repository for
metadata records and media. The Search API is the most straightforward to
use. It works in a similar fashion to the Europeana website when it comes
to interacting with the data. You can use the API to search for keywords,
and it will return any entries that contain those words. You can refine your
search with more advanced queries like Boolean Searches, or you can filter
out parts of the results advanced filtering.
}
\details{
In the `query` parameter the Apache Lucene Query Syntax is inheritly
supported by the Search API. Users can use Lucene and Apache SOLR guides to
get the most out of the Europeana repository.

The response is always formatted in JSON and will contain a
number of fields that present information about the handling of the
request, while the concrete information about the record is presented in
the "items" field (see Metadata Sets). The parsed information is stored in
the `content` field of the S3 object returned.
